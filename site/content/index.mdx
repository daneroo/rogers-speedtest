I ran some connectivity tests on Rogers (and Videtron for comparison) over a few days.

- a ping test (300 pings in 300s) every 5 minutes
- speedtest-cli every 5 minutes

*Notes:* The host running on Rogers (bell.ts.imetrical.com was a 
seriously underpowered 8 year old chromebook 
i.e. `Acer Aspire ONE 532H-2223 - 10.1" - Atom N450 - 1 GB RAM - 160 GB HDD - BIOS release Date : 2010-01-30`.
 It was updated to ubuntu 18.04 (from 12.04) for this test.

The Videotron test was run on a Mac Mini (mid 2011)

The dip in Rogers' speed between Aug 18th and 19th is explained
by moving the test box from a wired connection to Wifi,
dropping it's average speed from `90 Mb/s` to below `25 Mb/s`
